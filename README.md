# Face-recognition-based-attendance-system
Facial Recognition based attendance system consists a process of identifying and then verifying a student’s face for recording attendance by using facial biometrics through the help of any high definition monitor video or image and running some algorithms on it. In this attendance project, a PC framework will have this project installed to find and recognize student faces fast and precisely from images being captured through any camera device like webcam or a centralised camera. 

As we all know that manual recording of attendance in logbooks was always a tedious and
difficult task and it also wasted a lot of time and also there were chances of error too. So, this
project is visualised as an efficient model that consists of face recognition to manage the
attendance of students. This project also can enrol the student’s face if it is not present in the
source database which is only possible from authorised permissions. During enrolling of faces
we will definitely require a system. A student can have their own roll number as their student
id or institution can provide a separate id for the access which has to be unique. The presence
of each student will then be recorded accordingly in the database after his/her identification.
This system will give an accurate result in user interactive way rather than existing pen &
paper-based attendance keeping systems.
